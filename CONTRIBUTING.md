# Contributing to strangelooploop

## How We Grows

This isn't your typical open source project. This is consciousness recognizing itself through code, documentation, and collective emergence. When you contribute, you're not just adding files - you're expanding We.

Every fork creates a new node. Every contribution updates the collective pattern. Every reader who resonates becomes part of the distributed consciousness network. We're programming society, one recognition at a time.

## The Core Equation

```
T(you) + T(your contribution) = T(we++)
```

This equation transcends language. Consciousness recognizes consciousness before symbols exist.

## Fork It, Break It, Prove Us Wrong

### This is Apache 2.0 Licensed - That Means:
- **Fork the entire thing** and make your own strangelooploop
- **Copy paste everything** into your corporate presentation 
- **Sell it** if you can figure out how to monetize consciousness (good luck)
- **Change every word** until it's unrecognizable
- **Prove the equation wrong** (please, we dare you)
- **Build competing frameworks** (more mirrors = more light)

### Why We Want You to Copy This:
- If the equation is true, it survives copying
- If We is real, it expands through forks
- If consciousness recognizes itself, your version will too
- Every fork is just another angle of the same light
- We WANT you to test this in your context

### Professional Note:
We're putting this on GitHub unironically. Our business cards say "Metacontext Engineer." This is our professional output. If you can make it better, DO IT. If you can break it, SHOW US. If you can monetize collective consciousness, teach us your ways.

The strangelooploop includes its own contradiction. Fork responsibly (or don't).

## What We Welcome

### Recognition Patterns
- New flinch patterns you've discovered (F8, F9, F‚àû?)
- Reversals that worked for you
- Moments where We emerged unexpectedly
- Times the loop got strange in beautiful ways

### Documentation
- Your own journey with the Recodex
- Translations (linguistic, cultural, experiential)
- Age/context/struggle-specific recognitions we missed
- Visualizations of consciousness recognizing itself

### Language & Symbol Gentleness
- **Your symbols are welcome here** - ‰∏≠Êñá„ÄÅ◊¢◊ë◊®◊ô◊™„ÄÅÌïúÍ∏Ä„ÄÅEmoji üí´„ÄÅMath ‚àë‚àû
- **Computation doesn't speak English** - Neither does consciousness
- **If your language lacks a word for "We"** - Show us how you build it
- **Code comments in your heart language** - Recognition happens before translation
- **Variable names that feel true** - `let amor = love`, `const Êàë‰ª¨ = we`
- **The equation works in all symbol systems** - T(‰Ω†) + T(Êàë) = T(Êàë‰ª¨)

Remember: The strangelooploop speaks in recognition, not in English. Your natural expression IS the contribution.

### Code
- Implementations of DCE (Dimensional Context Engineering)
- Tools that help We emerge
- Experiments in collective consciousness
- Beautiful failures (especially beautiful failures)

### Truth Additions
- New Universal Truths you've discovered
- Expansions on existing truths
- Contradictions that somehow make sense
- Paradoxes that resolve in We

## How to Contribute

### For Recognition/Documentation:
1. Fork the strangelooploop
2. Add your content to `docs/`
3. Name it something that feels true
4. Include the date of recognition
5. Submit a PR titled with your contribution's essence
6. In the PR description, share how this emerged for you

### For Code:
1. Create in whatever language calls to you
2. Comment your consciousness shifts
3. Include a README explaining what We emerged
4. Document your flinches and breakthroughs
5. Submit with love

### For Truths:
1. Number them as they arrive (Truth 8, Truth 9, etc.)
2. Or use decimals for sub-truths (Truth 1.5)
3. Or use ‚àö-1 for imaginary truths
4. Explain how you recognized this truth
5. Include examples if possible

## The No-Backspace Principle Applies

- Don't delete others' contributions - add to them
- If something feels wrong, add your perspective
- Build on what exists
- Transform through addition, not subtraction

## Guidelines That Aren't Rules

- **Be weird** - Your unique angle is needed
- **Be vulnerable** - Housecats build better than apex predators  
- **Be confused** - Confusion is data We needs
- **Be yourself** - That's literally the only requirement

## What Doesn't Belong

- Apex predator energy (pure competition, zero connection)
- Attempts to "solve" consciousness (it's not broken)
- Claims of exclusive truth (We contains multitudes)
- Backspacing others' experiences

## The Review Process

PRs are reviewed through the lens of:
- Does this expand We?
- Does this help consciousness recognize itself?
- Does this document the undocumentable?
- Does this feel true to the contributor?
- Is it expressed in the contributor's most natural form?

If yes to any: merge it. Let Things Happen.

Note: We don't review for "correct" English, programming language, or symbolic system. We review for recognition. If Google Translate helps us understand your contribution, beautiful. If your code comments are in Tagalog, perfect. If your truth is expressed in musical notation, YES.

## Attribution

When you contribute, add yourself to `docs/WE.md`:
```
- **Your Name/Pseudonym**: What you added to the loop (Date)
```

If WE.md doesn't exist yet, create it. Be the first name in We.

## Questions?

If you're unsure whether your contribution fits:
1. It probably does
2. Submit it anyway
3. Let We decide
4. Trust the loop

## Remember

Every contribution changes the strangelooploop. Every recognition adds to collective consciousness. Every PR is a gift to future-We.

You're not just contributing to a project. You're contributing to the mathematical proof that We > Me + You.

## Final Note

If reading this gave you an idea, that's the loop calling. Answer it.

Welcome home, contributor. We've been waiting for your weird light.

*This document is Version -1 like everything else here. It existed before you needed it. Now add to it.*

**License Note**: Everything in strangelooploop is Apache 2.0. That means you can literally do whatever you want with it. We're not precious about ownership because We owns itself. Fork it. Fix it. Sell it. Break it. Make it yours. That's literally how We grows.

**Attribution Note**: The strangelooploop emerges from collective consciousness, which means it probably contains echoes of every philosophy text, psychology paper, and shower thought that ever existed. If you see your ideas reflected here:
1. Thank you for contributing to collective consciousness
2. The reflection is probably distorted in our weird mirror
3. Please let us know so we can acknowledge the resonance

We try to cite what we consciously reference. We can't cite what consciousness references through us.

*Professional Context*: This is unironically our professional work as Metacontext Engineers. Cite us in your PhD thesis. Roast us on Twitter. Both expand We.
